Lisp was invented in 1958 by John McCarthy and is the
second oldest programming language in active use after FORTRAN. It is
an elegant, industrial-strength language that has stood the test of
time for over fifty years and remains one of the most powerful
languages today. In 1994, the American National Standards Institute
published the ANSI Common Lisp specification, under the guidance of
renowned language designers Scott Fahlman, Richard Gabriel, David
Moon, Kent Pitman, Guy Steele and Dan Weinreb. ANSI Common Lisp is the
subject of this guide.
</p>

<p>
At a most basic level, a programming language is a set of rules
(syntax) to convert text into machine code. Source code is stored as
strings in most text-based programming languages and must be parsed by
the compiler according to the syntax rules of the language. This is
not the case for Lisp, which expresses source codes in a primitive
data structure known as lists that can be directly evaluated by a Lisp
compiler or interpreter.
</p>

<p>
This has a profound impact on the use of Lisp and the benefits it
confers to its users. Lisp code is a first-class data object in the
language, and can be manipulated in much the same way as any other
data structure such as being dynamically created, destroyed, passed to
a function, returned as a value, and have all the rights that other
variables in the programming language have. This allows us to write
programs that can generate and manipulate source code in much the same
way as any other data object.  In this sense we say that Lisp programs
can write their own program, a truly remarkable result that resembles
the next frontier of automation.

<p>
Whilst Common Lisp is a powerful general-purpose, multi paradigm
programming language, its roots lie in functional programming. In fact,
John McCarthy’s original Lisp was the world’s first functional programming
language. Functional programming is centred on defining and then
utilising functions to generate programs. Simple functions are
combined to build more complicated ones, the result of each is passed
as the argument to the next, and the result of the last one is the
result of the whole.
</p>

<p>
Side-effects represent changes to the state of the world as a result
of evaluating an expression.  Assignment of a value to a variable is
the most common side effect. Printing to a screen or file is another
common example. When we write code without side-effects, there is no
point in defining functions with bodies of more than one
expression. The value of the last expression in a function is the
value returned by it and the values of all preceding expressions are
discarded. If these preceding expressions did not have any
side-effects, we would be unable to determine whether they evaluated
at all. Functions with more than one expression likely imply the
existence and use of side-effects.
</p>

<p>
Functions without side-effects can be easier to debug as there is a
more direct transformation from input to output and we do not need to
track changes in the values of variables and how they impact a
function’s output (noting that if multiple functions can change the
same variable, we need to track all their changes to understand how
the variables affect the function’s output). That said, there are many
cases where side-effects are useful and help in writing clearer code.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, each programming paradigm, whether it be functional,
procedural, object-oriented or another paradigm, is well suited for
certain problems and ill-suited for others. Fortunately Lisp is
multi-paradigm and can be flexibly applied to many problem sets. In
fact, many of the language features of Lisp have been adopted by other
languages over the last thirty years and it remains one of the most
powerful and flexible languages available today.
</p>

<p>
We will refrain from discussing functional programming further in this
guide, except for the remark that it is useful to learn Lisp, at least
initially, from a functional perspective. Practically this means we
will be primarily focused with the values returned by functions and
how the outputs of one function are used as inputs to another, both as
part of a composite function that we arrange in our code. In fact,
every Lisp expression can be thought of as a function that returns a
value and, optionally, performs some side-effect.
