<p>
In large Lisp systems, with modules written by many different
programmers, accidental name collisions become a serious
problem. Packages are used to overcome this issue.
</p>

<p>
A package is a data structure that establishes a mapping from print
names (strings) to symbols. The string-to-symbol mappings available in
a given package are divided into two classes, external and
internal. Within a given package, a name refers to one symbol or to
none; if it does refer to a symbol, then it is either external or
internal in that package, but not both.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>External symbols are part of the package's public interface to other</li>
</ul>
<p>
packages. and are to be chosen with care. They are advertised to users
of the package.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Internal symbols are for internal use only, and are normally hidden</li>
</ul>
<p>
from other packages. Most symbols are created as internal symbols;
they become external only if they appear explicitly in an export
command for the package.
</p>

<p>
At any given time, only one package is current. This package is used
by the Lisp reader in translating strings into symbols. The current
package is, by definition, the one that is the value of the global
variable *​package​*.  It is possible to refer to symbols in packages
other than the current package through the use of package qualifiers
in the printed representation of the symbol. For example, FOO:BAR,
when seen by the reader, refers to the symbol whose name is BAR in the
package whose name is FOO. This is technically only true if BAR is an
external symbol of FOO. A reference to an internal symbol requires the
intentionally clumsier syntax FOO::BAR.
</p>

<p>
Symbols in the keyword package have two unique properties: (1) they
always evaluate to themselves and (2) they can be referred anywhere
simply as :X instead of KEYWORD:X.
