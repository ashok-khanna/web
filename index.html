Thank you for visiting my website. I like to write about Computer Science, Mathematics
and Design, with a focus on quality over quantity. In addition, I like to save down
valuable resources I find online, which you may also find useful too. Thank you for your
time and <a href="mailto:email@ashok.jp">contact me</a> if you find anything interesting.

I <a href="https://ashok-khanna.medium.com">also blog Medium</a>, where I have roughly 1,000 readers per month. I tend
to write first on Medium and later transfer a copy here. Medium
helps me gain visibility and some of my articles are top ranked in Google 
searches for their topics.

<p>
I also share some of my open source projects on <a href="https://ashok-khanna.github.io">GitHub</a>. A lot of my work
is private, but I try to contribute to open source and the free software
movement when I have time. Some of my contributions include:

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a href="https://github.com/ashok-khanna/lisp-notes">The Common Lisp Cheat Sheet</a> - My ongoing introductory guide to Common Lisp,
which is now featured on the Reddit Sidebar for r/lisp.</li>

<li><a href="https://pdf.math.dev">Beautiful PDFs from HTML</a> - My tutorial on using Paged.Js to produce paginated
media from HTML. It has been read over 20,000 times and currently has over 250
stars on Github. It is a good read for anybody looking to automate PDF report
generation by taking advantage of Chrome's rendering engine (preferably in a
headless setup). The accompanying Hacker News discussion can be found <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26691626">here</a>
(note that I changed website domains, so the web link on HN no longer works).</li>

<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rpn-30/id1451413517">RPN 30</a> - My highly rated Reverse Polish Notation calculator for iPhones.
It has over 15,000 downloads and counting, together with a 4.8/5 star rating
on the Apple App Store with roughly 50 reviews to date. A sample of its reviews
can be found <a href="file:///rpn30-reviews.html">here</a>. The full source code of this calculator is <a href="https://github.com/ashok-khanna/RPN-31">available here</a>,
and is a useful example for those trying to learn Swift &amp; SwiftUI.</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/ashok-khanna/math-hydras">Math Hydras</a> - My keybindings for inserting greek letters and mathematical symbols
