<p>
Welcome to AKhanna.Net! A website focused on the intersection of maths &amp;
technology. I am currently working on various mathematical software
using Common Lisp and this website documents all my knowledge in Lisp,
Emacs, Computer Science and Mathematics (more to come later on this - right
now my focus is on the technology stack). In addition, this website serves
as my public facing blog and also as a document store for valuable
resources I come across.
</p>

<p>
I hope you enjoy and find Math.Dev a useful resource for you. I love to
chat and get feedback from others, so please do drop me an e-mail at
ashok.khanna@hotmail.com if you have similar interests and would like to
chat some more. If you yourself work on Mathematical software, I would
<i>especially</i> like to hear from you! :)
</p>

<p>
A reasonable amount of my work is available on <a href="https://ashok-khanna.github.io">my GitHub profile</a>, so check
me out there!
