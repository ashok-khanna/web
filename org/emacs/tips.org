** Local CLHS Access in Emacs (31 July 2021)

Source: [[http://snowsyn.net/2020/01/01/local-clhs-access-in-emacs/][Nicolas Martyanoff Blog]]

To look up the symbol at point, use =slime-documentation-lookup= 
or =C-c C-d h=. To use a local copy of the HyperSpec, add something
like the following to your =.emacs=:

#+begin_src lisp

(setq common-lisp-hyperspec-root
      (concat "file://" (expand-file-name "~/folder-path/HyperSpec/")))

;; Then one of the two following options to set eww as the browser
;; for opening CLHS links:

(setq browse-url-browser-function 'eww-browse-url)

;; or to use the default browser for other links:

(setq browse-url-browser-function
      '(("hyperspec" . eww-browse-url)
	("." . browse-url-default-browser)))

#+end_src
