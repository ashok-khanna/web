* Lisp Blogging in Org

Today we will briefly discuss how to set up our own lisp blog, where we write in org-mode,
export to html and then publish to the web. We will be working mostly from
[[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-publish-html-tutorial.html][org-mode's official tutorial org-mode files to HTML]], and adapting it for our needs
as Lisp programmers.

To begin, let us scope out our requirements:

1. Creating blog posts entirely within org mode (from writing to publishing)
2. Minimising boilerplate 
3. Custom Stylesheets
4. Adding comments that don't get published
5. Code formatting
6. Copy/Paste mechanism
7. Running code from org mode into SLIME
8. Separating html from org
9. Additional shortcuts to make our life easier
10. Basics of Org Mode
